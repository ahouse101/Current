# Current
Current is a workspace synchronization tool built on top of git. It manages multiple projects, optionally keeping a branch up to date at all times (amending a commit with every change, similar to cloud storage). It also helps manage assets you don't commit to git, such as large media files or bulk data files, keeping them in sync via external systems without having to configure a git extension such as git-media or git-lfs.
